    My deepest appreciation goes to my supervisor, Mr. Kor Sokchea, whose expertise, mentorship, and unwavering support have been vital to the completion of this work. He has been not only an exceptional lecturer and supervisor but also a strong supporter at every stage. This research would not have been possible without his guidance.

    Finally, I want to express my heartfelt thanks to my family for their financial support, constant encouragement, and unconditional love. Their sacrifices and belief in me have been the driving force behind my achievements. I am especially grateful to my sister, who has always believed in me and supported every decision I madeâ€”thank you for always standing by my side.
