    {\large This is to certify that the dissertation that I, Vitou Soy, hereby present, entitled "Advancing
    Khmer Optical Character Recognition: A Synthetic Data-Driven Approach," for the degree
    of Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology at the Royal University of Phnom Penh, is
    entirely my own work. Furthermore, it has not been used to fulfill the requirements of any
    other qualification, in the whole or in part, at this or any other University or equivalent
    institution. The research methodology, implementation, and findings represent original con-
    tributions to the field of Khmer OCR technology, particularly in developing novel approaches
    for synthetic data generation and transformer-based text recognition. Through this work, I
    have demonstrated strong research capabilities and independence in addressing the critical
    challenges of Khmer text digitization and recognition.\par}
